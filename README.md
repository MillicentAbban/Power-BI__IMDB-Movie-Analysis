### IMDB-Movie-Analysis

An analysis of an Imdb dataset of movies that were produced between 1960 and 2015 .
The dataset consist of information that could be useful to a potential investor/ 
stakeholder in a movie production. The data contains information on different movies,
the releases dates, the directors, the production companies, the genres, the budgest 
involved, the revenue gained and a profit column I added .

There were a couple of questions I wanted to address which include :
 - Which movies had the most budget ovet the period ?
 - Which movies made the most Profit ?
 - What kind of genres were gaining more profit ?
 - Who were the most popular directors based on the number of movies and profit ?
 - Is there a relationship or link between budget and revenue gained ?
 - Can we also identify any relationship between the durationof the movie and the 
  profit gained ?
  
During the course of getting the data ready there were some issue that were identified 
and had to be dealt with . Some of those issue include :
 - Removing blank columns from the budget and revenue columns
 - Removing the columns with 0 values as they were incorrect entries.
 - Removing columns that were inconsistent with the data entries
 
A set back in this analysis is the inaccurate and inconsistent data entries. As a 
result of this a lot of data was lost during the cleaning process. If the data was more 
reliable i could have dug deeper and expanded the analysis further .
